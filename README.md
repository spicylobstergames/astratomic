Astratomic is a survival game that draws inspiration from the likes of Noita and Starbound.
Powered by a similar engine as Noita, made from scratch with Rust.

## Controls
- You can walk with WASD and jump with Space. When on air press Space again to activate your jetpack!
- Left Mouse button to pull atoms, Right Mouse button to push atoms.
- Press 1-4 to select the atom you can push.
- Mouse wheel to zoom in/out.

## Where to play it

- Go to our latest release page https://github.com/spicylobstergames/astratomic/releases/tag/v0.2.0
- Download the zip for your platform, unzip it and run the executable, it's that simple!

## Current State and Goals

**We currently implemented:**
  - Chunk system
  - Smart updating of only what's needed
  - Multithreaded sand simulation
  - GPU rendering optimizations of the sim
  - AABB colliders for the player and mobs
  - Player with special gun to push and pull atoms, and also a jetpack
  - Bigger map, with saving/loading
  - More types of atoms! Like lava, acid, seeds, ...

**What's next:**
  - Rapier2d rigidbodies (with simulated pixels) for things you can throw!
  - Procedurally generated worlds
  - Procedural Animations
  
In the bigger picture we also aim to achieve intergalactic travel like Starbound, procedurally generated animations inspired by Rainworld, all the cool mechanics you see in Noita, multiplayer and modding, the last two made possible by a future engine migration to [Bones](https://github.com/fishfolk/bones/).

## Licensing

In the future we aim to separate the engine code from the game code, making the former licensed under Apache v2.0 and the latter under PolyForm NonCommercial v1.0.
